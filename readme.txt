== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is your documentation? =
You can find our WordPress documentation here:
[http://rating-widget.com/support/wordpress/](http://rating-widget.com/support/wordpress/?utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=free&utm_source=wordpress.org)

= Do you support Google's Rich-Snippets? =
**Yes we do!** Rich-Snippets schema.org metadata integration is supported in our [Professional and Business plans](http://rating-widget.com/pricing/wordpress/?utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=free&utm_source=wordpress.org). We have many customers which have the ratings shown in Google SERP (Search Engine Results Page). We follow Google's best practices and constantly improve the plugin according to the newest updates to make sure that your pages will pass [Google's official rich snippets testing tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets). But, **we cannot guarantee that Google will show your stars in the search results**. Why? Unfortunately, we don't have access nor control of Google's algorithms. The algorithm which decides whether to show the stars (or not) is based on the search keywords, page popularity, device type, country, and many more variables. Our recommendation: if you are willing to risk one month of payment for the Professional plan, upgrade, and give it between 2-3 weeks to see if Google "liked" your site. If the ratings will be synced with the search results - AWESOME! If not, simply downgrade back to the Free version. Note - there won't be any refunds for claims about the Rich-Snippets.

= I just upgraded for the Rich-Snippets, how do I make sure the metadata is configured correctly? =
Follow this [short guide to test the rich-snippets](http://rating-widget.com/support/wordpress/rich-snippets/how-can-i-check-that-ive-correctly-configured-the-rich-snippets-ratings-for-google-serp/?utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=free&utm_source=wordpress.org#platform)

= Can I try your plugin paid features before I upgrade? =
 **Yes you can!** Install the free plugin, then go to RatingWidget -> Account, and click the "Free Trial" tab.

= The WordPress plugin don’t work, where are my ratings? =
Don’t panic – you are not alone! Your custom theme’s developer forgot to call `wp_footer()` in the footer template file (usually named footer.php). Our star ratings core JavasScript is loaded on this action hook. Once this fixed the ratings should appear.
More info here - [http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks)

= My homepage not showing any ratings, what’s wrong? =
Make sure your Front Page ratings are enabled for excerpts. In addition, your theme’s front page template must use `the_excerpt()` method to show/load the excerpts. We use this method’s hook to add the rating code.

= The RatingWidget WordPress plugin don’t show ratings on my comments, what’s wrong? =
First, make sure you’ve enabled the ratings for comments in your admin’s dashboard. Once you sure it’s enabled, but still doesn't work, a common cause can be that your theme isn’t using `comment_text()` to display the comments text. A common mistake by theme developers is the use of `get_comment_text()` instead of `comment_text()`. Try to switch between those and it should fix the issue. If you are awesome, contact the theme developer and let him know about the issue so he can fix it for everyone else.

= Can I add a rating inside my WordPress post’s content?
Check out our [editor shortcodes](http://rating-widget.com/support/wordpress/can-i-add-a-rating-inside-my-wordpress-posts-content/?utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=free&utm_source=wordpress.org)

= Is there any PHP shortcodes I can use for my custom posts templates? =
Check out our [PHP shortcodes](http://rating-widget.com/support/wordpress/is-there-any-php-shortcodes-i-can-use-for-my-custom-posts-templates/?utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=free&utm_source=wordpress.org)

= Do you support Infinite Scroll? Do you support ratings for content loaded dynamically via AJAX? =
Check out our [special AJAX refresh code snippet](http://rating-widget.com/support/wordpress/do-you-have-a-refresh-code-for-ajax-loaded-content/?utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=free&utm_source=wordpress.org)

= Where can I suggest new features? =
You are welcome to [submit ideas](http://rating-widget.com/contact/?platform=wordpress&topic=feature%20request&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=free&utm_source=wordpress.org) for cool features that you'd like to see in the plugin.

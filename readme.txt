We know that your time is valuable, therefore we've created this sticky topic to help you find a solution as quickly as possible.

3. If you face a technical problem/issue, please keep reading.

Before you rush into adding another topic to the support forum, please read the following most **Frequently Asked Questions** and solutions:

> **Problem: The WordPress plugin don’t work, where are my ratings?**
>
> **Solution:** Don’t panic – you are not alone! Your custom theme’s developer forgot to call `wp_footer()` in the footer template file (usually named footer.php). Our star ratings core JavasSript is loaded on this action hook. Once this fixed the ratings should appear.
>
> More info here - [http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks)

---

> **Problem: My homepage not showing any ratings, what’s wrong?**
>
> **Solution:** Make sure your Front Page ratings are enabled for excerpts. In addition, your theme’s front page template must use `the_excerpt()` method to show/load the excerpts. We use this method’s hook to add the rating code.

---

> **Problem: The RatingWidget WordPress plugin don’t show ratings on my comments, what’s wrong?**
>
> **Solution:** First, make sure you’ve enabled the ratings for comments in your admin’s dashboard. Once you sure it’s enabled, but still doesn’t work, a common cause can be that your theme isn’t using `comment_text()` to display the comments text. A common mistake by theme developers is the use of `get_comment_text()` instead of `comment_text()`. Try to switch between those and it should fix the issue. If you are awesome, contact the theme developer and let him know about the issue so he can fix it for everyone else.

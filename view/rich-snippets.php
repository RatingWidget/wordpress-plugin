                We have many customers which have the ratings shown in Google SERP (Search Engine Results Page). We follow Google's best practices and constantly improve the plugin according to the newest updates to make sure that your pages will pass <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets" target="_blank">Google's official rich snippets testing tool</a>.
                But, <b>we can NOT assure that Google will show your stars in the search results</b>. Why? Unfortunately we don't have access nor control of Google's algorithms. The algorithm which decides whether to show the stars (or not) is based on the search keywords, page popularity, device type, country and many more variables. Our recommendation: if you are willing to risk one month of payment for the Professional plan, upgrade, and give it between 2-3 weeks to see if Google "liked" your site. If the ratings will be synced with the search results - AWESOME! If not, simply downgrade back to the Free version. Note - there won't be any refunds for claims about the Rich-Snippets.
